## 1.More Exercise: Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements and Loops

Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;Technology Fundamentals&quot; course @ SoftUni.](https://softuni.bg/courses/programming-fundamentals)

You can check your solutions in [Judge](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1461/).

1. 1.Sort Numbers

 Read three real numbers and sort them in descending order. Print each number on a new line.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 213 | 321 |
| -213 | 31-2 |
| 002 | 200 |

1. 2.English Name of the Last Digit

Write a **method** that returns the **English name** of the last digit of a given number. Write a program that reads an integer and prints the returned value from this method.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 512 | two |
| 1 | one |
| 1643 | three |

1. 3.Gaming Store

Write a program, whichhelps you buy the games. The **valid games** are the following games in this table:

| **Name** | **Price** |
| --- | --- |
| OutFall 4 | $39.99 |
| CS: OG | $15.99 |
| Zplinter Zell | $19.99 |
| Honored 2 | $59.99 |
| RoverWatch | $29.99 |
| RoverWatch Origins Edition | $39.99 |

On the first line, you will receive your **current balance** – a **floating-point** number in the range **[0.00…5000.00]**.

Until you receive the command &quot; **Game Time**&quot;, you have to keep **buying games**. When a **game** is **bought** , the user&#39;s **balance** decreases by the **price** of the game.

Additionally, the program should obey the following conditions:

- If a game the user is trying to buy is **not present** in the table above, print &quot; **Not Found**&quot; and **read the next line**.
- If at any point, the user has **$0** left, print &quot; **Out of money!**&quot; and **end the program**.
- Alternatively, if the user is trying to buy a game which they **can&#39;t afford** , print &quot; **Too Expensive**&quot; and **read the next line**.

When you receive &quot; **Game Time**&quot;, **print** the user&#39;s **remaining money** and **total spent on games** , **rounded** to the **2**

# nd
 **decimal place**.
### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |

1. 4. Reverse String

Write a program which reverses a string and print it on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| Hello | olleH |
| SoftUni | inUtfoS |
| 1234 | 54321 |

1. 5.Messages

Write a program, which emulates **typing an SMS** , following this guide:

| **1** | **2** abc | **3** def |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **4** ghi | **5** jkl | **6** mno |
| **7** pqrs | **8** tuv | **9** wxyz |
|   | **0** space |   |

Following the guide, **2** becomes &quot; **a**&quot;, **22** becomes &quot; **b**&quot; and so on.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 54433555555666 | hello | 9443399908443377733 | hey there | 76333380633 | meet me |

### Hints

- A native approach would be to just put all the possible combinations of digits in a giant **switch** statement.
- A cleverer approach would be to come up with a **mathematical formula** , which **converts** a **number** to its **alphabet** representation:

| **Digit** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|
- **Index**
 |
- 0 1 2
 |
- 3 4 5
 |
- 6 7 8
 |
- 9 10 11
 |
- 12 13 14
 |
- 15 16 17 18
 |
- 19 20 21
 |
- 22 23 24 25
 |
|
- **Letter**
 |
- a b c
 |
- d e f
 |
- g h i
 |
- j  k  l
 |
- m  n  o
 |
- p  q  r  s
 |
- t u v
 |
- w  x  y  z
 |

- Let&#39;s take the number **222** ( **c** ) for example. Our algorithm would look like this:
  - Find the **number of digits** the number has &quot;e.g. **222**** 3 digits**&quot;
  - Find the **main digit** of the number &quot;e.g.   **222**** 2**&quot;
  - Find the **offset** of the number. To do that, you can use the formula: **(main digit - 2) \* 3**
  - If the main digit is **8 or 9** , we need to **add 1** to the **offset** , since the digits **7** and **9** have **4 letters each**
  - Finally, find the **letter index** (a 0, c 2, etc.). To do that, we can use the following formula: **(offset + digit length - 1)**.
  - After we&#39;ve found the **letter index** , we can just add that to **the ASCII code** of the lowercase letter &quot; **a**&quot; (97)
