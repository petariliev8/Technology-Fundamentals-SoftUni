# Problem 1. Vapor Winter Sale

_Our favorite gaming platform, Vapor, has started its yearly winter sale. Stamat wants to buy some games and he wants to make a list._

Your task is to take **every game** and add it **with its price**. The games **may have DLCs** (downloadable content), which you should also add. The games will be given in the following format **&quot;{game}-{price}&quot;**. The game names will contain only letters, digits and spaces. The DLCs will be given in the following format **&quot;{game}:{DLC}&quot;**. **All the of the inputs** will be divided by **&quot;, &quot;**. You should only add the DLC **if the game already exists**. The DLC **increases** the game price by **20%**.

After you have processed all the games you should **lower the prices** of all the games by **20%**** if they don&#39;t have a DLC **and by** 50% ****if they do**. After this you should print the games **with DLCs** , **ordered ascending**** by price **, and then all the games** without DLCs **,** ordered descending by price**, in the following format:

- If the game **has** a DLC:
  - **oo****&quot;{game} - {DLC} - {price}&quot;**
- If the game **doesn&#39;t have** a DLC:
  - **oo****&quot;{game} - {price}&quot;**

The prices should be formatted to the second decimal place.

## Input

One **string** with inputs, divided by **&quot;, &quot;**. Each input of the string will be in one of the following formats – **&quot;{game}-{price}&quot;** or **&quot;{game}:{DLC}&quot;**.

You don&#39;t have to check the input, it will always be valid.

## Output

**&quot;{game1} - {DLC} - {price}&quot;**

**&quot;{game2} - {DLC} - {price}&quot;**

**...**

**&quot;{game n} - {price}&quot;**

**&quot;{game n + 1} - {price}&quot;**

**...**
